# ChatAPI

ChatAPI is a Java-based API that integrates with OpenAI’s GPT models and image generation models like DALL-E. It allows for text-based completions and image generation requests through the OpenAI API. The project is built with Maven and uses Retrofit for API requests.

## Features

- **Chat Completion**: Send text-based requests to the OpenAI API to generate responses from GPT models.
- **Image Generation**: Create images based on text prompts using OpenAI’s image generation API (e.g., DALL-E).
